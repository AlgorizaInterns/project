# notice:
### the project is not 100% done yet because i ran out of Time; ... Because the lack of experience dealing with VueJS since its the first project for me with VueJS .. so i faced some problems and of course the time wasted in searching.

### The missing features and functionalities :-
- #### responsive menus
- #### top-nav popup menus
- #### darkmode switch
- #### language change
- #### Accessibility features i.e (keyboard navigation , screen reader optimization)
- #### add to cart and wishlist
- #### paggination
- #### rating filter

### mistakes i am aware of :-
- #### Huge components that need to be separated (I did that because of lack of experience with Vue state management techniques)
- #### poor files structure
